# Travel Social Net - System Design

Homework forÂ [course by System Design](https://balun.courses/courses/system_design). Travel Social Net is a social network for travelers.

### Functional requirements:
- user can create post about theirs trips  with photos, description and coordinates to the poi
- other users can write comments and rate to the post
- user can subscribe to other users to keep track on their activity
- user can view posts feed of the other user he subscribed
- user can view posts feed of the other user
- search for popular sights and view posts about it
### Non-functional requirements:
- 10 000 000 DAU
- high availability, ~99,95%
- posts and media are always stored
- could be seasonality - more users before holidays (~20% users more)
- CIS audience only (most text must be in Cyrillic)
- on average:
	- each user view about 50 posts every day (includes search and looking through the feeds) with 20 comments each (search could take up to 3-5 seconds, view post details - 1 second, loading media - maximum 1 second per photo)
	- each 10th user rate one post and write one comment (max 1 second for both operations)
	- each 100th user write a new post with ~5 photos (max 1 second for write operations and 1 sec for every image upload)
	- each 1000th user register a new location
## Basic calculations

### Entities
#### Location (225B)
- **id** - int64 - 8B
- **caption** - 100 Unicode chars ~200B
- **coordinates** - 2 x double - 8B+8B
- **avgRate** - 1B (3-4 bits must be enough)

#### Post (~2025B ~= 2.1KB)
- **id** - int64 - 8B
- **userId** - int64 - 8B
- **text** - 1000 Unicode chars ~2000B
- **locationId** - int64 - 8B
- **avgRate** - 1B (3-4 bits must be enough)

#### Photo (~210B metadata + ~2MB content)
- **id** - int64 - 8B
- **caption** - 100 Unicode chars ~200B
- **content** ~2MB

#### Comment (~525B)
- **id** - int64 - 8B
- **userId** - int64 - 8B
- **postId** - int64 - 8B
- **text** - 250 Unicode chars ~500B

#### Rate (17B)
- **userId** - int64 - 8B
- **postId** - int64 - 8B
- **value** - 1B (3-4 bits must be enough)

### Operations
#### Create Location
	each 1000th user create a new location
DAU: 10 000 000 / 1000
RPS: 10 000 / 86 400 ~= 0.12
w/traffic: 0.12 * 225B ~= 23B

#### Create Post
	each 100th user write a new post with 5 photos
DAU: 10 000 000 / 100
RPS: 100 000 / 86 400 ~= 1.2
w/traffic: 1.2 * (2.1KB + 5 * 210B + 5 * 2MB) ~= 12MB (data: 3.8KB  + media: 12MB)

#### Create Comment
	each 10th user rate one post and write one comment
DAU: 10 000 000 / 10
RPS: 1 000 000 / 86 400 ~= 12
w/traffic: 12 * 525B ~= 6.5MB/s

#### Rate Post
	each 10th user rate one post and write one comment
DAU: 10 000 000 / 10
RPS: 1 000 000 / 86 400 ~= 12
w/traffic: 12 * 17B ~= 204B (can be ignored)

##### The highest workload among write operations: 
- upload media on post creation - 12MB/s
- write comment - 6.5MB/s

#### Read Posts
	each user view about 50 posts every day (includes search and looking through the feeds)
DAU: 10 000 000
RPS: 10 000 000 / 86 400 ~= 120
r/traffic: 
 - data: 120 * 50 * (2.1KB + 5 * 210B) ~= 120 * 50 * 14KB = 1.7MB/s
 - media: 120 * 50 * 5 * 2MB = 60GB/s

#### Read Posts' Comments
	each user view 20 comments for every 50 viewed post
DAU: 10 000 000
RPS: 10 000 000 / 86 400 ~= 120
r/traffic: 
 - data: 120 * 50 * (20 * 525B) ~= 63MB

#### Read Rates
	each user view rate for every 50 viewed post
DAU: 10 000 000
RPS: 10 000 000 / 86 400 ~= 120
r/traffic: 
 - data: 120 * 50 * 17B ~= 102KB (can be ignored)
